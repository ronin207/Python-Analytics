        "  <li>You may find that the 'Cheerleader' program we discussed in the live session is not yet perfect. One of the most significant flaws is that it gives wrong articles for some of the letters. For example, the correct sentence should be, 'Give me an I', but the program prints 'Give me a I'. We want to correct this mistake in the updated version of the 'Cheerleader' program. Another change is to use upper case when each letter is shouted out. Write a program to incorporate these two changes to the 'Cheerleader' program.<br>\n",
        "<em><strong>Please note</strong>: The usage of the articles 'a' or 'an' depends on how we pronounce a letter. In addition to the vowels (A, E, I and O), other letters that have vowel sounds in pronunciation (such as F, H, L, M, N, R, S and X) also take the article 'an'. The letter U, although a vowel, is pronounced as 'yew' and hence takes the article 'a'.</em></li>\n",

        "  <li>Write a number guessing game. In this game, a target integer between one and ninety-nine is given. The user can enter an integer as a guess. If the guess is the same as the given target number, then print 'Bingo!' and stop the program. Otherwise, print 'Your guess is too small' or 'Your guess is too large' as the hint for the next guess and continue the guessing game.</li>\n",
