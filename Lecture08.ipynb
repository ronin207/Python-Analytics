        "2. Are the patients’ waiting time distributions similar across different public hospitals? Draw a line chart to compare the median waiting time across different public hospitals.\n",
        "3. To make a staffing plan, which decides the number of nurses and doctors needed to serve patients, a deep understanding of patient arrivals is crucial. The staffing plan in practice will be made on an hourly basis (24 intervals) every day. Create a new column, <code>REGIS_HOUR</code> in df. Moreover, the patients’ arrival pattern may vary by the day of a month. Also create a new column, <code>REGIS_DAY</code> in df.\n",

        "5. The assumption that the arrival pattern is similar across different days is too strong to be true. Let's discuss the daily effect (including Saturday and Sunday) on the arrival pattern of patients. Create a <code>WEEKDAY</code> column in df. For example, if a patient's arrival occurred on 01/10/2011, the corresponding value in <code>WEEKDAY</code> column would be Saturday.\n",
        "6. With the <code>WEEKDAY</code> column, find the average number of patient arrivals in each hour by daily categories. Your answer should be a 7-by-24 table.\n",
